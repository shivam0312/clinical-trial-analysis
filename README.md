# clinical-trial-analysis
A R and Machine Learning Project

The project considers clinical trial dataset. We pool the conditions, interventions and eligibility criteria from relevant trials to predict whether a candidate is eligible for a clinical trial or not. We used protocols from cancer clinical trials that were available in public registries from the last 18 years to train our model, and we constructed a dataset of short free-texts using NLP labelled as eligible or not eligible. A text classifier was trained using multiple models like KNN, SVM, Na√Øve-Bayes and fastText to predict eligibility status of the candidates.
